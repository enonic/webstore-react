# webstore-react

A webstore built with React and Redux using the Enonic platform with Repositories and Headless site.

This React website is a demonstration and is not to be used in production.

# This package contains:
* service of html with a webpack bundle
* React-Redux implementation
* storage of objects and images on the Enonic built-in repository system-repo
* storage of objects and images on the Enonic Headless cms site
* (shallow)implementation of Material-ui 


# Setting up headless
The headless demo (/headless) enables getting data from XP content studio.
To enable this, do the following: 
* Create a site called Webstore-react 
* Set site path as "headless" 
* Create 'product'-items in content studio
